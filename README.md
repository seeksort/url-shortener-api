# url-shortener-api

(Python, Flask) A service that will shorten a long URL and redirect to the original site when given the short URL.

I wanted to try out Flask and Python in the backend, so I decided to do a little project that still uses some HTML and a small database. 

Flask is lightweight and reminds me of Express.js. Being familiar with what I can do with Express.js really made it easier for me to look for what I wanted to do in the Flask docs.

This is one of the [Free Code Camp API projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice).
